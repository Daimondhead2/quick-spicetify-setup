# quick-spicetify-setup
Some quick scripts I made for a few friends to install my custom spicetify set-up for them  
# Make SURE you have Spotify installed already!  
# NOT THE WINDOWS STORE VERSION
# THE INSTALLER VERSION  
# THIS ONE: https://www.spotify.com/us/download/windows/
  
1) Download "spicetify.ps1" and "spicetify-pre-req.ps1" from the latest release on the right side of this page
2) Press the Windows Key + X and click on Windows Powershell (Admin)
3) Navigate to the directory you downloaded the .ps1 file using cd (probably should type cd $home\Downloads)
4) Right Click the "spicetify.sp1" script and select "properties"
5) Click "Unblock towards the bottom of the screen"
6) Accept any warnings stated
7) Run the script by typing ".\spicetify.ps1" without the speech marks
8) Repeat steps 4 - 7 for the "spicetify-pre-req.ps1"
9) ???
10) Profit

I did not make any of this, I simply got a script ready that should match my local setup :P
