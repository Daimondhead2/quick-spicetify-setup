# quick-spicetify-setup
A quick script I made for a few friends to install my custom spicetify set-up for them  
# Make SURE you have Spotify installed already!  
# NOT THE WINDOWS STORE VERSION
# THE INSTALLER VERSION  
# THIS ONE: https://www.spotify.com/us/download/windows/
  
1) Press the Windows Key + X and click on Windows Powershell (Admin)
2) Navigate to the directory you downloaded the .ps1 file using cd (probably should type cd $home\Downloads)
3) Run the script by typing ".\spicetify.ps1" without the speech marks
4) ???
5) Profit  
  
# IF MUSICXMATCH DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY, FOLLOW THE GUIDE AT https://github.com/khanhas/genius-spicetify#musicxmatch !!!
  
I did not make any of this, I simply got a script ready that should match my local setup :P
